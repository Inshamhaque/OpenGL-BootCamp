## OPEN GL bootcamp 

1. Open GL is an API which drectly interacts with the device graphics driver and thus enable in gui rendering by interacting with the OS. 
2. Now, in order to make the the application work cross platform, we need a libarary like GLFW which makes it easier for us to not to write seprate code bases for linux, win, mac. 
3. Now, thus creating a basic window is easy using GLFW. 
4. Now, there are numerous functions which help the OpenGL to interact with the graphic drivers. Thus, in order to make the process of accessing these functionalities easy to access, we use GLEW. 
5. A simple implementation of OpenGL using GLEW and GLFW has been in the **tut1.cpp** file
